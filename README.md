# health_data
Python and R functions to generate files that look like data from Norwegian Health Registers (Norwegian Patient Data, Prescription Data, primary care, SSB). Synthetic artificial data for teaching and developing scripts. Very basic, but with some distriubutional logic and cross correlations. Includes sample data files and common id across registers.
