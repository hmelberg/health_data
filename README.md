# health_data
Python and R functions to generate data that looks like data from Norwegian Health Registers (Norwegian Patient Data, Prescription Data, primary care, SSB). Synthetic artificial data for teaching and developing scripts. Very basic, but with some cross correlations. Includes sample data files.
